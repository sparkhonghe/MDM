Code of Methylation-Driven Model for Analysis of Dinucleotide Evolution in Genomes

Step 1: "K-mers Statistic" for Table 2

Step 2: "CpGIslandSeacher", "CpGsland_ Results_Sta" and "NCpGM motif finder" for Supplementary Table 5(Table 3)

          1. "CpGIslandSeacher"-> "CpGsland_ Results_Sta" -> get Results_1

          2. NCpGM motif finder -> get Results_2
          
          3. Results_2 - Results_1 = Supplementary Table 5(Table 3)
          
Sorry, the program is not easy to understand. We are rewriting this code in  Python. The rewritten code will be very concise and easy to understand, and we will release it in the next step research.
